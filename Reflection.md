## Overview

The portfolio website for mine serves as a personal branding tool that showcases skills, experiences, and services offered. As a sophomore student in the College of Science and Technology, the portfolio reflects the journey and aspirations of a budding designer and developer.


## Structure & Design
The website is divided into four main sections: 
- Navigation bar
- Header 
- About me
- Services
- Skills
- Contact
- Footer 


## Main Concept Applied

The concept applied are:

- sementic HTML structure: using semantic HTML element like '<nav>', '<section>', '<footer>', '<img>', etc to define the structure of the webpage/personal profile page.

- Separation of concerns: separating the content through the use of an external stylesheet ('profile.css').

- User-Centric Design: conveying clear navigation links, a straightforward layout and sections assigned to personal branding like "Home", "About Me", etc.

- Responsive Design: using CSS media queries to ensure the website adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

- Visual element: use of images (profile.jpg and intro.jpg) to adds a personal touch and visual appeal to the portfolio.

- Social Media integration: insertion of social media icons using Font Awesome to connects the portfolio with external platforms, allowing people to explore my online presence.

- Footer: to ensure that the content ownership is clear.


## Challenge
- hover effect
- Accessibility Issues
- Code Readability and Maintainability

## Solution

- hover effect: using CSS to create a hover effect on the navigation bar and other elements to enhance like on button.

- Accessibility Issues: using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to improve accessibility issues.

- Code Readability and Maintainability: using CSS classes and IDs to improve code readability and maintainability.


## Conclusion
Overall, the HTML code for this personal portfolio efficaciously combines good web development practices with user-centric design principles, creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing online presence. The structure is clear, the content is well-organized, and the site is designed to engage people to showcase the indiviual's skills.
